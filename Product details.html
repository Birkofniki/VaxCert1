<h3>Product details</h3>
<ol>
	<li>VaxCert would create a blockchain-based platform to issue and verify digital vaccination certificates. These certificates would be stored on an immutable ledger as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) linked to an individual's verified identity.</li>
	<li>Individuals would obtain a VaxCert NFT after receiving a vaccine dose from an authorized provider. <br>The NFT would contain details like vaccine type, batch, date administered, etc.</li>
	<li>Verifiers such as border agents, venue staff, employers could instantly check someone's vaccination status by scanning their VaxCert NFT. <br>The blockchain would provide a tamper-proof record of immunizations.</li>
</ol>
