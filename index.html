	<em>Hint-Digital vaccination certificates stored on a blockchain to verify immunization status across borders.</em>
	<!--this is a sentence stating the general idea -->
</h5>
<h3>What it is?</h3> <!--The clear explanation of what I had in mind -->
 <p>I am proposing a new blockchain project called VaxCert that would create digital vaccination certificates stored on a blockchain ledger. This would allow individuals to easily verify their immunization status when crossing borders or accessing services that require proof of vaccination.</p>
 <h3>Its advantages?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Increased trust and integrity of vaccination records</li>
	<li>Reduced risk of fraudulent or forged paper certificates</li>
	<li>Seamless verification process for vaccination requirements</li>
	<li>User convenience - records accessible anytime from an app</li>
	<li>Helps reopen travel and economy by enabling proof of vaccination</li>
	<li>Potential to integrate with other health records for comprehensive view.</li>
</ul>
